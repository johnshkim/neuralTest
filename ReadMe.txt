Neural Test. 

i've finished the trainning but missed the image correction. 
The saved model is in the path- model_save

The path jupyter have the tranning with keras(Or the ipynb archive- NeuralTest).

I was trying to implement the image correction, so haven't implement the .py archive to test with csv.
